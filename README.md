### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am an Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="https://www.vita-group.space/team" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>VITA group</a> of UT Austin, working with <a href="https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/atlas-wang">Prof. Atlas Wang</a>. I received my PhD at <a href="https://github.com/tmlr-group" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning (TMLR) Group</a> in the <a href="https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/en.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Hong Kong Baptist University</a>, advised by Dr. <a href="http://bhanml.github.io/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Bo Han</a>. I was a visiting student researcher at <a href="http://www.ml.cmu.edu/">CMU MLD</a>, fortunately working with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/">Prof. Pradeep Ravikumar</a>, and I was a research intern at <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/">RIKEN AIP</a>, fortunately working with <a href="https://niug1984.github.io/">Dr. Gang Niu</a> and <a href="https://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sugi/">Prof. Masashi Sugiyama</a>. Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree of Computer Science and Technology <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80%E5%AD%A6%E7%A7%91%E6%8B%94%E5%B0%96%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E5%9F%B9%E5%85%BB%E8%AF%95%E9%AA%8C%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92" target="_blank">(Top-notched Student Program)</a> from <a href="http://www.scu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Sichuan University</a> in 2021.

My research interests lie in building human-aligned machine intelligence, particularly in developing methodologies that improve model <i>robustness</i> (e.g., for adversarial examples), <i>reliability</i> (e.g., for out-of-distribution data), and <i>transparency</i> (e.g., for functionality and traceability), as well as its applications to ``construct responsible AI`` and ``benefit social goods``. I am always open for possible collaborations. Please feel free to drop me an email if there is any suitable ideas or opportunities to discuss.
